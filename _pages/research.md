Our group conduct both scientific experiments and advanced computation for energy materials, utilizing some of the world's most powerful 
research facilities:


<b>Computation</b>
<br>
We develop advanced data science algorithms, including machine learning, deep learning, data mining, to solve scientific 
questions that can hardly be answered by traditional studies.
