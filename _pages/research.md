Our group conduct both scientific experiments and advanced computation, utilizing some of the world's most powerful 
research facilities:

# Computation
We develop advanced data science algorithms, including machine learning, deep learning, data mining, to solve scientific 
questions that can hardly be answered by traditional studies.




# Experiments
We travel and carry out synchrotron x-ray, neutron, and electron scientific experiments across the world:
