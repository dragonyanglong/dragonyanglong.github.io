  abstract = {Developing novel energy storage materials is critical to many renewable energy technologies. In this work, we report on the synthesis and electrochemical properties of materials composed of porous cobalt selenide microspheres prepared from molecular cluster precursors. The cobalt selenide microspheres excel as Na+ ion battery electrode materials, with a specific capacity of {$\sim$}550 mA h/g and excellent cycling stability of 85\% over 100 cycles, and perform equally well as Li+ ion battery electrodes with a specific capacity of {$\sim$}600 mA h/g and cycling stability of 80\% over 100 cycles. Materials which reversibly store large amounts of Na+ ions are uncommon, and these performances represent significant advances in the field. More broadly, this work establishes metal chalcogenide molecular clusters as valuable precursors for creating new, tunable energy storage materials.}

  abstract = {Here, using a combined theoretical and experimental approach, we have investigated the interaction mechanism of titanium carbide MXene with a variety of organic molecules whose end groups are O, S, N, and tertiary amines. All organic molecules intercalated between MXene layers; however, layer expansion followed the end group of the organic molecules. A broad range of optical spectroscopies confirmed that the nature of interactions/reactions of titanium carbide MXene with organic molecules is also end group-dependent that involve a variety of complex interactions between MXene and organic molecules such as electrostatic interactions, polymerization, strong binding, and in some cases catalytic decomposition of the organic molecules. First-principles calculations revealed that organic molecules tend to stay flat on the MXene surface during molecular assembly and that the binding and charge transfer from organic molecules to MXene occur, which are strongly end group-dependent, corroborating the experimental observations. The impact of interactions/reactions within the MXene\textendash organic heterostructures on pseudocapacitance is further discussed.}

Interfacial Gilbert-type relaxation, due to the spin pumping effect, is predicted to be significantly larger for magnetization oriented parallel to compared with perpendicular to the film plane. Here, we have measured the anisotropy in the Pt/Ni81Fe19/Pt system via variable-frequency, swept-field ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). We find a very small anisotropy of enhanced Gilbert damping with sign opposite to the prediction from the Rashba effect at the FM/Pt interface. The results are contrary to the predicted anisotropy and suggest that a mechanism separate from Rashba spin-orbit coupling causes the rapid onset of spin-current absorption in Pt.},

  abstract = {Ba(Ti,Fe)O3 is a useful system for the exploration of multiferroic properties as a function of composition and variation in structure, based upon a model of intersubstitution of the B site cation. Nanocrystals of Ba(Ti,Fe)O3 could be used as building blocks for composite multiferroic materials, provided ferroic properties are recognizable at this length scale and Ti and Fe serve as ideal models for the case of d0 versus dn in a ferroic perovskite. A series of iron-substituted barium titanate nanocrystals (BaTi1\textendash xFexO3) were synthesized at 60 \textdegree C using a hybrid sol\textendash gel chemical solution processing method. No further crystallization/calcination steps were required. The as-prepared nanocrystals are fully crystalline, uniform in size ({$\sim$}8 nm by TEM), and dispersible in polar organic solvents, yielding nanocrystal/alcohol formulations. Complete consumption of the reactant precursors ensures adequate control over stoichiometry of the final product, over a full range of x (0, 0.1 to 0.75, 1.0). Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis enabled in-depth structural characterization (phase, space group, unit cell parameters, etc.) and shows that, in the case of x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, BaTiO3, and BaTi1\textendash xFexO3 nanocrystals, it is concluded that they are tetragonal noncentrosymmetric P4mm with lattice parameters increasing from, e.g., c = 4.04 to 4.08 \AA. XPS analysis confirms the presence of both Fe3+(d5) and Fe4+(d4), both candidates for multiferroicity in this system, given certain spin configurations in octahedral field splitting. The PDF cacluated lattice expansion is attributed to Fe3+(d5, HS) incorporation. The evidence of noncentrosymmetry, lattice expansion, and XPS conformation of Fe3+ provides support for the existence of multiferroicity in these sub-10 nm uniform dispersed nanocrystals. For x {$>$} 0.5, Fe impacts the structure but still produces dispersible, relatively monodisperse nanocrystals. XPS also shows an increasing amount of Fe4+ with increasing Fe, suggesting that Fe(IV) is evolving as charge compensation with decreasing Ti4+, while attempting to preserve the perovskite structure. A mixture of Fe3+/Fe4+ is thought to reside at the B site: Fe4+ helps stabilize the structure through charge balancing, while Fe3+ may be complimented with oxygen vacancies to some extent, especially at the surface. The structure may therefore be of the form BaTi1\textendash xFexO3-{$\delta$} for increasing x. At higher concentrations (Fe {$>$} 0.5) the emergence of BaFeO3 and/or BaFe2O4 is offered as an explanation for competing phases, with BaFeO3 as the likeliest competing phase for x = 1.0. Because of the good dispersibility of the nanocrystals in solvents, spin coating of uniform 0\textendash 3 nanocomposite BaTi1\textendash xFexO3/polyvinylpyrrolidone thin film capacitors ({$<$}0.5 {$\mu$}m) was possible. Frequency dependent dielectric measurements showed stable dielectric constants at 1 MHz of 27.0 to 22.2 for BaTi1\textendash xFexO3 samples for x = 0\textendash 0.75, respectively. Loss tangent values at 1 MHz were {$\sim$}0.04, demonstrating the ability to prepare capacitors of magnetic Ba(Ti1\textendash xFex)O3 with relatively high permittivity. Magnetic characterization by MPMS (both magnetic hysteresis loops and zero field and field cooling measurements) showed increased magnetization with increasing Fe ion concentration. Weak magnetic coercivity and a small remanence magnetization is observed ({$<$}5 K), implying a weak ferromagnetic state at low temperatures ({$<$}5 K).}

  abstract = {MXenes are a rapidly growing class of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, finding applications in fields ranging from energy storage to electromagnetic interference shielding and transparent conductive coatings. However, while more than 20 carbide MXenes have already been synthesized, Ti4N3 and Ti2N are the only nitride MXenes reported so far. Here by ammoniation of Mo2CTx and V2CTx MXenes at 600 \textdegree C, we report on their transformation to 2D metal nitrides. Carbon atoms in the precursor MXenes are replaced with N atoms, resulting from the decomposition of ammonia molecules. The crystal structures of the resulting Mo2N and V2N were determined with transmission electron microscopy and X-ray pair distribution function analysis. Our results indicate that Mo2N retains the MXene structure and V2C transforms to a mixed layered structure of trigonal V2N and cubic VN. Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements of the nitrides reveal that they exhibit metallic conductivity, as opposed to semiconductor-like behavior of their parent carbides. As important, room-temperature electrical conductivity values of Mo2N and V2N are three and one order of magnitude larger than those of the Mo2CTx and V2CTx precursors, respectively. This study shows how gas treatment synthesis such as ammoniation can transform carbide MXenes into 2D nitrides with higher electrical conductivities and metallic behavior, opening a new avenue in 2D materials synthesis.},

Only a handful of stable ultrathin magnetic materials have been reported, but their high-yield synthesis remains a challenge. Transition metal (e.g., manganese) nitrides are attractive candidates for spintronics due to their predicted high magnetic transition temperatures. Here, a lattice matching synthesis of ultrathin Mn3N2 is employed. Taking advantage of the lattice match between a KCl salt template and Mn3N2, this method yields the first ultrathin magnetic metal nitride via a solution-based route. Mn3N2 flakes show intrinsic magnetic behavior even at 300 K, enabling potential room-temperature applications. This synthesis procedure offers an approach to the discovery of other ultrathin or 2D metal nitrides.},

Unique interconnected two-dimensional (2D) arrays of few-nanometer TMN nanocrystals not only having electronic conductivity in-plane, but also allowing transport of ions and electrolyte through the porous nanosheets, which are obtained by topochemical synthesis on the surface of a salt template, are reported.

  abstract = {The MgTi2O4 spinel exhibits a metal-insulator transition on cooling below Ts{$\approx$}250 K, accompanied by Ti t12g orbital ordering and spin-singlet dimerization with associated average symmetry reduction to tetragonal. By combining x-ray and neutron pair distribution function analyses to track the evolution of the local atomic structure across the transition we find that local tetragonality already exists in the metallic globally cubic phase at high temperature. Local distortions are observed up to at least 500 K, the highest temperature assessed in this study. Significantly, the high-temperature local state is not continuously connected to the orbitally ordered band insulator ground state and so the transition cannot be characterized as a trivial order-disorder type. The shortest Ti-Ti spin-singlet dimer bond lengths expand abruptly on warming across the transition, but remain shorter than those seen in the cubic average structure. These seemingly contradictory observations can be understood within the model of a local fluctuating two-orbital t2g orbital degeneracy lifted (ODL) precursor state derived from electron filling, Ti substructure topology, and point symmetry considerations. The ODL state in MgTi2O4 has a correlation length of about 1 nm at high temperature. We discuss that this extended character of the local distortions is consistent with the two-orbital nature of this state imposed by the charge filling and the bond charge repulsion. The MgTi2O4 spinel exemplifies multiorbital ODL state and presents the possibility of a widespread presence of such precursor states in scarcely studied high-temperature regimes of transition-metal-based quantum materials.},
