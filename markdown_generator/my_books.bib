  abstract = {``This article describes the application of total scattering and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) studies to the study of local and intermediate range structure in complex materials. We give a brief introduction to the methods, and then survey a sampling of different applications of them in various inorganic chemistry applications, including energy materials, nanoparticles, layered materials, metal organic frameworks and host-guest systems, polycrystalline thin films, atomic clusters, hybrid-perovskites. We also discuss studies of local magnetism and amorphous materials.''},
