In June 2025, Hai Qiao completed his undergraduate thesis defense titled "A Study on Material Atomic Structure 
Prediction Based on Deep Neural Networks". The XRDStructGen system is developed based on generative AI models, which can 
 predict crystal structures directly from x-ray diffraction (XRD) data. His thesis was selected as one of the university 
outstanding undergraduate theses. 

He will continue to pursue a doctoral degree at the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Tongji University. 
Congratulations!

祝贺课题组成员本科生乔海荣获校级优秀本科毕业论文
======

2025年6月，课题组本科生乔海完成了他的本科毕业设计《基于深度神经网络的材料原子结构预测研究》，提出了基于生成式模型的XRDStructGen系统，
可从X射线衍射（XRD）数据直接预测材料的晶体结构，并且被选为校级优秀毕业论文。

他将在同济大学材料科学与工程学院继续攻读博士学位。祝贺乔海！
