REal Space Iterative Reconstruction (RESIRE) is an advanced algorithm for reconstructing a 3D object from a set of 2D projections, i.e., tomography.
It iterates between the update of a reconstructed 3D object and the measured projections using a forward and back projection step, resulting in ultrahigh real-space resolution.
The source codes are available in the following link.
