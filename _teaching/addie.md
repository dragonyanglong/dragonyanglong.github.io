ADvanced DIffraction Environment (ADDIE) is a cloud-based comprehensive platform for hosting tools for neutron powder 
diffraction experimental planning, automatic Bragg and pair distribution function refinement, etc.
It also includes useful tools for both diffraction and total scattering experiments, specifically designed for instruments
at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
